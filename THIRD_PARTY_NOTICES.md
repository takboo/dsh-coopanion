# Third-party notices

## Coopanion runtime (AGPL-3.0-or-later)

This application includes and adapts code from [Pal-AI-Lab/Coopanion](https://github.com/Pal-AI-Lab/Coopanion), commit `d7b1a0026fed3eb1975a6e0387527d806192cdbf`, package `packages/cortico-world-desktop-pet`. The vendored body, mesh rig, whale figure/model, sandbox protocol and synthesized sounds are under `web/upstream/`; its manifest reader is adapted in `src/upstream/packs.ts`. Speech timing and bubble styles are adapted in `web/speech.js` and `web/style.css`.

The combined program is distributed under **AGPL-3.0-or-later**, with the full license in `LICENSE`. Original dsh-coopanion code's MIT notice is retained in `LICENSE-MIT`. The exact imported version and modifications made on 2026-10-09 are documented in `web/upstream/UPSTREAM.md`. The installed program offers its corresponding source through **菜单 → 下载本版本源码**, including all source, vendored files, build scripts and the dependency lockfile; the npm archive also includes these files.

## DeepSeek Whale artwork and marks

The textures and thumbnails in `web/upstream/whale/`, and the generated tray icon `desktop/icon.png`, are excluded from upstream's AGPL grant. Original character: 溟月（上善无形）; DeepSeek maid reinterpretation: ZipZipPipe; generated/split artwork: Pal-AI-Lab using OpenAI's image model. Vendor marks belong to their respective owners and do not imply endorsement.

This integration follows the project user's existing statement that the community character is reusable. AGPL does not relicense these textures. The complete original upstream rights notice is preserved verbatim in [web/upstream/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](web/upstream/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). Its sections on speech-recognition libraries/models describe the upstream package; this plugin does not bundle those components.

## Electron

Electron 44.7.0 is installed as a dependency and retains its MIT license and Chromium's accompanying notices. Runtime download and verification remain unchanged.
